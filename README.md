Air Quality Insights: Understanding Pollution and Its Impact
📌 Overview
This project aims to analyze real-time air quality data across various U.S. states and counties to uncover pollution trends, evaluate the most affected regions, and understand the impact of pollutants over time. It leverages data science tools in Python to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualize trends, and perform hypothesis testing.

🎯 Objectives
1.Identify the Top 10 most polluted states based on average pollutant levels
2.Analyze the year-wise trend in air quality across the U.S.
3.Study pollution patterns in the top counties
4.Visualize pollutant distribution by state using pie charts
5.Explore correlation between different air pollutants
6.Compare pollution across states using boxplots
7.Examine exceedance days for Ozone and PM2.5 using histograms
8.Perform a Z-test to check if a specific year had significantly different pollution levels

🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
